        <p><strong>David Mark Weber</strong> (born October 24, 1952) is an American science fiction and fantasy author. He has written several science-fiction and fantasy books series, the best known of which is the Honor Harrington science-fiction series.

        <h3>Writing Career</h3>
        <p>Born in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 24, 1952, Weber began writing while in fifth grade. Some of Weber's first jobs within the writing/advertising world began after high school when he worked as copywriter, typesetter, proofreader, and paste-up artist. He later earned an undergraduate degree from Warren Wilson College in Asheville, North Carolina and a M.A. in history from Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Weber's first published novels grew out of his work as a wargame designer for the Task Force board wargame Starfire. Weber used the Starfire universe as a setting for short stories that he wrote for the company's Nexus magazine, and he also wrote the Starfire novel Insurrection (1990) with Stephen White after Nexus was canceled; this book was the first in a tetralogy that concluded with their final collaboration, The Shiva Option (2002), which was included in The New York Times Best Seller List.</p>
